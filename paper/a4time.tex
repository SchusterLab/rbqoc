\section{Computational Performance \label{appendix:time}}
We provide runtimes for our optimizations and comment on the problem size of the
robustness methods. The runtimes for
the base optimization in Section \ref{sec:fluxonium},
the depolarization optimization in Section \ref{sec:longitude},
and the robust optimizations in Section \ref{sec:static}
are presented in Table \ref{tab:time}
for a $Z/2$ gate at gate times which are multiples of $1/4f_{q} \sim 18$ns.
We performed optimizations on a single core of
an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32-Core Processor.
Future work will parallelize the robustness methods using GPUs
\cite{leung2017speedup},
which will enable fast optimizations on high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Now we note the size of the augmented state vector for the robustness methods.
For the sampling method, the size of the augmented state vector
is $O(dn^{3})$, where $d$ is the number of uncertain parameters and
$n$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space. There are $n^{2}$ initial states
in the operator basis, $2d$ sample states per initial state,
and each state has $2n$ real numbers.
For the unscented sampling method, the size of the augmented state vector
is $O(dn^{3} + n^{4})$.
There are $n^{2}$ initial states in the operator basis,
$2(2n + d)$ sample states per initial state,
and each state has $2n$ real numbers.
For the $m$\textsuperscript{th}-order derivative method, the size of the augmented state vector
is $O(dmn^{3})$. There are $n^{2}$
initial states in the operator basis, $dm$ state derivatives per initial state,
and each state has $2n$ real numbers.
