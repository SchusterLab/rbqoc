\section{QOC on the Fluxonium}
In the following we study
the quantum optimal control problem on the fluxonium qubit.
The fluxonium qubit is a promising building block for superconducting
circuits, and the experimental constraints we encode in the optimization reflect
those of a realistic device. Furthermore, the accurate
two-level approximation of the system Hamiltonian makes it
efficient to perform quantum optimal control on
a classical computer. In the two-level
approximation the system Hamiltonian takes the form
\begin{align}
  H/h &= f_{q} \frac{\sigma_{z}}{2} + a(t) \frac{\sigma_{x}}{2}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian}
\end{align}
where $f_{q} = 14$MHz is the qubit frequency at the flux frustration point,
$a$ is the flux drive amplitude, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $\sigma_{x}, \sigma_{y}$
are Pauli matrices. The flux amplitude $a$ is experimentally
realized by modulating the flux 
threading the device. We consider the task of constructing $Z/2$, $Y/2$, and $X/2$
gates for the fluxonium qubit subject to experimental constraints, decoherence, and
systematic errors. We compare the gates we obtain with numerical
methods to the analytically constructed gates reported in
\cite{zhang2020universal} for the same device.

\todo{I highly suggest writing out the optimization problem explicitly here. I've started it 
for you below. You can reference the individual lines as you explain your problem setup.
Also explicitly spell out what your state and control vectors are.}

In addition to imposing optimization constraints that
reflect physical limitations of the apparatus, we impose
constraints that improve the experimental realization of the control pulse.
To ensure gates may be concatenated arbitrarily without
inducing AWG ringing due to high-frequency transitions,
we require $a(t = 0) = a(t = t_{N}) = 0$.
Furthermore, we require $\int_{0}^{t_{N}} a(t) dt = 0$. This
constraint ensures the pulse has zero net flux, mitigating
the hysteresis ubiquitous in flux bias lines,
\cite{battistel2019fast, krantz2019quantum, zhang2020universal}.
We require $-0.5 \textrm{GHz} \le a(t) \le 0.5 \textrm{GHz}$
to ensure the two-level approximation \eqref{eq:hamiltonian}
remains valid. Additionally, we require that each gate achieves
the desired state transition $\ket{\psi_{N}} = \ket{\psi_{f}}$.
In addition to these constraints we penalize the norm
of the first and second derivatives of the flux amplitude to
ensure its smoothness, and in doing so mitigate AWG ringing.
The optimization is performed over the second derivative of the flux amplitude
$\pdv*[2]{a}{t}$ which is contained in the
augmented control vector. The first derivative
$\pdv*{a}{t}$, proportional $a$, and integral $\int a$
flux amplitude terms
are contained in the augmented state vector. They are obtained from
the second derivative of the flux amplitude by
integration in the dynamics function.
Both the zero net flux and target quantum state constraint
are then handled by ensuring the target augmented state is
reached $x_{N} = x_{f}$, the constraint functional 
\todo{not sure what the convention is in your community, but for us a functional is a 
function of functions (or trajectories). This would just be a function. Also, shouldn't 
this just be $x_N = x_f$ and $\abs{x_k} \le b$? Why are you squaring the functions?}
 takes the form
$c_{k} = (x_{k} - x_{f})^{T}(x_{k} - x_{f})$.
The equality and inequality constraints on $a$ are handled
with a bound constraint which takes the form
$c_{k} = (x_{k} - b)^{T}(x_{k} - b)$ if $\lvert x_{k} \rvert \ge b$
and $0$ otherwise.
In addition the norm of the quantum state
is constrained to ensure discretization error is not
exploited $c_{k} = {\lvert \braket{\psi_{k} \lvert \psi_{k}} \rvert}^{2} - 1$.
\todo{is this last constraint supposed to be an inequality constraint?}

In addition to obeying experimental constraints
and achieving low simulated gate errors, we desire
to make our gates perform well in the presence of decoherence.
Decoherence of the quantum state due to external noise
is typically modeled by two phenomena: longitudinal relaxation and pure dephasing.
They are modeled using their $1/e$ decay times $T_{1}$ and $T_{\phi}$ respectively.
The main contributions to longitudinal relaxation in our
device are dielectric loss in the capacitor, resistive loss in the inductor,
and Purcell loss. The main contributions to pure dephasing in our
device are $1/f$ flux noise and decay via charge and flux coupling
to the control lines.
Dissipation to the thermal bath via longitudinal
relaxation is an irreversible process
that results in information loss.
Converesely, pure dephasing is a reversible process.
Our device achieves its best pure dephasing
protection at the flux frustration point
$T_{2e}(a = 0) \sim 300 \mu\textrm{s}$
where the qubit is first-order insensitive to changes in flux.
It becomes more succeptable to pure dephasing as the flux is tuned away from the flux
frustration point $|a| > 0$. Conversely, longitudinal relaxation is at a minimum
at the flux frustration point $T_{1}(a = 0) = 0.315$ms,
and increases away from the flux frustration point
$T_{1}(a = 0.34 \textrm{GHz}) = 4.3$ms. Given the nature
of the decay processes and the tradeoff, we choose
to maximize the longitudinal relaxation time directly
by tuning the flux amplitude and employ robust control techniques to mitigate
pure dephasing.

\todo{maybe reference the next Sections as you mention these points?}
